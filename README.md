# Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart

[Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart](http://drupal.org/project/apigee_devportal_kickstart) is a Drupal distribution that allows to quickly try out or get started using Drupal to create an Apigee developer portal.

This project is a [Drupal installation profile](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/distributions) which needs to be added to Drupal core and installed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). The [installation instructions](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-developer-portal-kickstart/get-started-with-kickstart)  use the [Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart Composer project](https://github.com/apigee/devportal-kickstart-project-composer) to install Drupal core and this installation profile to create a site.
